![img](pics/3D_view.png)

> The BC2_VolCtrl PCB implements a universal volume control based on the popular ALPS RK168 motor potentiometer. Balance setting is available via knob control only. The volume can be controlled via
>
> - The old school way, turning the knob
>
> - Standard infrared remote controls (several IR protocols)
> - Telnet interface (Wi-Fi)
>
> The PCB was designed for the Black Cat 2 audio tube amplifier. As the design of the PCB is universal, it may be easily integrated in other do-it-yourself amplifier projects.
>
> The amplifier itself was designed by  Henry Westphal and his students at the technical university of Berlin in Germany. Schematic and documentation are available [here](https://www.emsp.tu-berlin.de/menue/studium_und_lehre/mixed_signal_baugruppen_alt/das_projekt_black_cat/) (only German).

> The amplifier lacks a remote control for the volume. The appearance is retro with a complete analog signal chain. I wanted to keep the signal chain analog. A motorized potentiometer fits well.

## **Features**

> A list of handy features and functions of the PCB and firmware.

### Functions 

- Motor potentiometer for a complete analog signal chain
- Balance setting via knob control
- Simultaneous use of multiple IR-Remotes (i.e. control via both TV and CD-Player remotes )
- Support of multiple IR-protocols (Sony, NEC, RC5, ...)
- Position recognition of volume potentiometer
- Set-up via a simple command based telnet Wi-Fi connection
- Volume control via a telnet Wi-Fi connection (Andriod APP required)
- ESP-Link firmware with all features on the ESP8266 - Wi-Fi module

### Circuit Design 

- LT3622 wide Vin step down converter (designed for VCC=12V)
- ATmega 328pb Atmel microcontroller
- UART-1 and one GPIO available at external connector (unsed)
- Black-Cat 2 tube amp compatible connectors and layout
- Layout and GND separation of control and analog signals
- Stop position recognition of volume potentiometer for improved lifetime
- H-bridge motor driver with 15us shoot through protection
- Several debugging LEDs
- Farnell bill of materials

## Description

### IR Protocols

The firmware uses the awesome [irmp library (Infrared Multiprotocol Decoder)]( https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/IRMP_-_english#top) written by Frank Meyer. The library is able to decode several infrared protocols (refer to IRMP documentation for a complete list). Most of the IR-protocols have a unique start bit timing which IRMP uses to distinguish different protocols. 

To enable or disable protocols simply edit /FW/IMRP/irmpconfig.h. Every protocol will require a few bytes of RAM. By default the most common IR-protocols are enabled:

```c
#define IRMP_SUPPORT_SIRCS_PROTOCOL		1  		// Sony SIRCS 			~150 bytes
#define IRMP_SUPPORT_NEC_PROTOCOL 		1       // NEC + APPLE 			~300 bytes
#define IRMP_SUPPORT_SAMSUNG_PROTOCOL   1       // Samsung + Samsg32  	~300 bytes
#define IRMP_SUPPORT_KASEIKYO_PROTOCOL  1       // Kaseikyo 			~250 bytes
#define IRMP_SUPPORT_RC5_PROTOCOL       1       // RC5 					~250 bytes
#define IRMP_SUPPORT_RCII_PROTOCOL      1       // RCII T+A 			~250 bytes
```

Some IR-Remotes i.e. from CD-Players use different protocols for the majority of function keys and volume controls. For example my camebride audio CD-player remote uses the camebrige protocol for all function keys and the RC5 protocol for the volume up an down keys.

## First time setup



- Most people will glance at your `README`, *maybe* star it, and leave
- Ergo, people should understand instantly what your project is about based on your repo
